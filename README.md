# Camera Gallery
An Android camera application with a simple gallery along with it. Feel free to fork it in case of need of an already built application!

## About
The initial grid view shows all images saved on the project folder `DCIM/CameraGallery/<ImageName>`. As soon a picture is taken, it saves the image on the same path. If you want to, you can click the preview image right next to the camera button and see the last picture that was taken. It will also let you navigate through all images saved so far.
